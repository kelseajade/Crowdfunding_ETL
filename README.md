# Crowdfunding_ETL

I created the Campaign DataFrame by extracting data from the 'crowdfunding.xlsx' Excel file into a pandas DataFrame. I renamed the 'blurb' column to 'description', converted 'goal' and 'pledged' columns to float data type, and converted 'launched_at' and 'deadline' columns to datetime format while renaming them to 'launch_date' and 'end_date'. Additionally, mI merged the 'category_id' and 'subcategory_id' columns on identification numbers. Then, I assembled all the transformed data into a new DataFrame with the specified columns. Finally, campaign DataFrame was exported as 'campaign.csv'. The CSV file can be found under resources.

For the Contacts DataFrame, I imported 'contacts.xlsx' Excel file. I created a loop to iterate through the data, converting each row to a dictionary. I extracted values from the keys using list comprehensions and created a new DataFrame.This was done with help from the professor asd well as a previous class example. The 'name' column was split into first and last names, placed in separate columns, and then deleted the name column within the DataFrame. Finally I exported the cleaned contacts DataFrame as 'contacts.csv' and saved it in the Resources folder.
